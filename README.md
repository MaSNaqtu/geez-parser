Was machen wir damit?  
Mail Eugenia Sokolinski (20112024):   Dear Samuel,
the parser was developed a while ago by Pietro Liuzzo, but it has not been further maintained lately as we have not been using it and we do not have any IT staff member on board to look after it at the moment, so any improvements are more than welcome. I do not think that we have capacities at the moment to develop anything along that end, as there is no project at the moment here that can afford this, but we will be happy if what we have can be reused and made available to anyone in a more sustainable way.  
The [latest version] is here (https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/betamasa-prod/tree/main/backup/full20220725-0500/db/apps/parser) but I think it is the same as the one stored with FDM.  
I will ask Pietro Liuzzo if he is available for any questions concerning the application and in case he says yes I will put you in touch, if needed.
Many thanks and wishes  
Eugenia
